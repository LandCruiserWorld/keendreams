## 💡 Unique Insights

### 1. **Cloudflare's Marketing Genius**
Their public assets tell a compelling story on their own. By using their official images, we inherit their credibility.

### 2. **The "330 Cities" Superpower**
This number appears in 7+ images. It's the single most powerful credibility signal - use it everywhere.

### 3. **Performance Proof > Performance Claims**
Charts showing real latency data are 10x more convincing than saying "blazing fast."

### 4. **Resilience = Trust**
The submarine cable outage graph is the most underutilized asset. It's concrete proof of reliability during real-world failures.

### 5. **Simplicity vs Sophistication Balance**
The architecture diagrams show 12 integrated layers - proving sophistication. But the clean design proves simplicity. This balance is key.
